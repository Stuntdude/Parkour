               Hello . 
               <br>
               My name is Himanshu Duseja.
               <br>
               I made this website for the project of my html course and my interest in parkour.
               <br>
               In the following points i'll show how I began parkour and what all moves i've learned uptill now.

    		<h1>The <span class="highlight">beginning</span></h1>
    		<p>
    			One day I was scrolling through youtube and I found a cool video showing some great moves and tricks.
    			<br>
    			I got surprised by that and watched it about 10 times till the next day.
    			<br>
    			So i began watching such videos from the reccomendations and a few days later i learned that it's a sport called parkour.
    			<br>
    			I then started watching tutorials for some moves and practiced them on two nearby placed beds.
    			<br>
    			I got more and more involved in it and continued such practice. And this was how I got into parkour.

    		<h1>My(few) <span class="highlight">Skills</span></h1>
    		<p>
    			Though I am not able to learn much of these moves as in India this sport is considered as more of monkey moves and is not given support.
    			<br>
    			People think that it is nothing but an easy way to injure yourself.
    			<br>
    			Despite of such situation I learnt a few things such as:
    			<br>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Dive Roll-(The best trick I can do)</li>
    				<li>Safety rolls on jumps</li>
    				<li>Precision jumps</li>
    				<li>Half Flips(180deg)</li>
    				<li>And a few other basics</li>
    			</ul>
