    		<h1><span class="highlight">Pasha the Boss</span></h1>
    		<p>
                Pavel ‘Pasha’ Petkuns is a Latvian freerunner and Red Bull Art of Motion champion who believes that the sky really is the limit.
                <br>
                Pavel Petkuns, known to his friends and fans as Pasha, is a freerunner from Daugavpils, Latvia. With his creative bar work and the easy fluidity 
                of his movement, Pasha really stands out from the crowd. 
                <br>
                Pasha made a name for himself after the release of his first showreel in May 2009, which 
                showcased many original moves. His creative and innovative take on freerunning has made him a master of urban spaces – the Latvian is always 
                looking to create new tricks and has surprised his fans with his training methods. 
                <br>
                His dedication and originality make him one of the strongest 
                freerunners in the world.
                <br> 
                Pasha has picked up two Red Bull Art of Motion titles and come very close to taking a third victory on Santorini Island. 
                But for Pasha, it’s not all about the wins – he says that freerunning gives him everything that he wants in life – fun, food and friends.

            <p>
                Erik Mukhametshin is a Professional freerunner, parkour athlete and stuntman who is known for posting a variety of his work to his Instagram followers 
                and a lot of YouTube subscribers.  
                <br>
                He first began training in Judo at 3 years old. He then began training in parkour and continued to excel. After watching the movie YAMAKASI, 
                he chose to pursue a career as a freerunner. 
                <br>
                He has won several awards for the sport including the WFPF Pro-AM Championship at Mandalay Bay in 2016. 
                <br>

            <h1><span class="highlight">Dimitris Kyrsanidis</span></h1>
            <p>
                Dimitris Kyrsanidis was inspired to become a parkour athlete after he decided he wanted to do something extraordinary, something different from the 
                stuff he did every day.
                <br>
                He first started freerunning when he was 12 years old with his friends from his neighborhood in Thessaloniki, Greece. He believed that football, 
                basketball, volleyball and all the other sports in the media were too ordinary, too casual for him. He was impressed by the jumps, rolls and flips 
                involved in parkour.
                <br>
                For Dimitris, freerunning is not just a hobby, it's his life. “I do my training every day like people eat dinner every day," he says. "I do it not 
                because I have to, but because freerunning is my life.”
                <br>
                Winning the 2014 and 2015 editions of Red Bull Art of Motion in Santorini brought him worldwide fame and catapulted him into the freerunning elite. 
                <br>
                When he isn't competing, he spends his time travelling the world, entering in professional freerunning contests, jams and workshops, and contributing 
                to growing the sport's popularity.

            <h1><span class="highlight">David Belle</span></h1>
            <p>
                David Belle (born 29 April 1973) is considered by many to be the founder of modern Parkour. Belle founded Parkour based on his training and the 
                teachings from his father Raymond Belle. The discipline has since spread around the world and now has adherents in virtually every country. 
                Belle is also an actor and choreographer, and he is well known for his work incorporating Parkour into films such as in District B13, Babylon A.D.
                 and Prince of Persia.
                <br>
                David Belle was born and raised in Fécamp, France. He descends from a modest family in the suburbs of Paris. His grandfather Gilbert Kitten, father 
                Raymond Belle, and brother Jeff Belle have been highly skilled rescuers in the French military fire service.
                <br>
                In 1984, at the age of 11, Belle mollved to Lisses, France. He made close friends with a group of teenagers with a similar physical passion who began 
                training with him. Some of the friends that trained with Belle would later become known as the Yamakasi. Later in life, Belle spent time in the military 
                and fire brigade with aspirations of following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps. He left soon after for personal reasons in order to dedicate 
                himself to Parkour.

            <h1><span class="highlight">Damien Walters</span></h1>
            <p>
                Damien Walters from Derby, United Kingdom is a professional stuntman, gymnastics coach and free runner. Before retiring from his career as a gymnast 
                in 2007, he represented Great Britain in several championships. At his peak he was ranked 4th in the world, winning the European and world championships 
                with his team. He remembers his first attempt at a trick being a frontflip on grass when he was 4 or 5 years old, which he failed, leading to his mother 
                enrolling him in gymnastics.
                <br>
                With Damien’s extensive tumbling and gymnastics skills, many free running moves come naturally to him. He was first noticed in the community after 
                releasing his 2007 showreel, which featured many movements inspired by free running. This video got him scouted by Jackie Chan’s stunt agent. Subsequently, 
                he retired from gymnastics to pursue a career as a stuntman, where he is currently a part of a core group of stuntmen who work for Brad Allan, the first 
                non-Asian member of Jackie Chan’s stunt team

            <h1><span class="highlight">Dominic Di Tommaso</span></h1>
            <p>
                Di Tommaso, or 'Domtomato' as he is known, started freerunning back in 2007 following a background in ballet and figure skating and a full-time job 
                as a garbage man.
                <br>
                He trains with Crew 42 and became a part of Team Farang in 2016, having known them since back in 2011, and he's been a regular at Red Bull Art of 
                Motion in recent years.
                <br>
                Tommaso says: "I love freerunning, it gives me an outlet for my passion in movement without the restrictions or guidelines I found in other organised 
                sports.
                <br>
                "It excites me to know that the possibilities are seemingly endless. I’m so happy to be a part of the community that advocates support and progression 
                for each and every freerunner involved."

            <p>
                Legendary free runner Jason Paul Jason now spends his time travelling the world, turning cities into playgrounds.
                <br>
                "Free runners are like a kids on the playground,” says world-class free runner, Jason Paul. “They run around, try new things and test out their limits.” 
                Jason’s fascination for his sport is still as vibrant today as it was back in 2005 when he first caught the free-running bug.
                <br>
                One day, his best bud came round clutching a video tape that, unbeknownst to him, would change Jason’s life forever. That tape was a documentary on Parkour. 
                From that day on, Jason saw the world in a new light – rooftops suddenly became pathways and obstacles became opportunities.
                <br>
                Jason now spends his time travelling the world, turning cities into playgrounds – a frontflip in Frankfurt, a Moon Kick in Moscow and a Tic Tac in Tokyo. 
                He's also a former champion at Red Bull Art of Motion. In 2010, he took first places in both Boston and Vienna, and was crowned champion again in Japan 
                the following year. He has also taken second places in Sweden and Florida and third place in Santorini in 2012.
                <br>
                Jason also loves making freerunning videos. In one of his movies, Human-Powered Free Running Machine, he can be seen jumping between upturned shipping 
                containers seconds before they fall like dominoes. The video consists of a large-scale chain reaction that demonstrates the timing, precision and playfulness 
                of the sport. “That’s what we’re like, that’s our kind of humour,” he says.
                <br>
                In recent years, Jason has continued to be the star of a series of video edits, such as Arcade Run, Dreamland, Running Illusions, Last Call for Mr Paul, Freeze 
                Running and 2019’s Running Reverse, as well as Jason Paul Goes Back in Time.
