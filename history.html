    		<p>
                The word parkour derives from parcours du combattant (obstacle course), the classic obstacle course method of 
                military training proposed by Georges Hébert.Raymond Belle used the term "les parcours" to encompass all of his 
                training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal 
                athletic advancement.His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, 
                and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the "c" 
                of "parcours" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, 
                forming "parkour"
                <br>
                A practitioner of parkour is called a traceur, with the feminine form being traceuse.They are nouns derived from 
                the French verb tracer, which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.[20] The 
                verb tracer used familiarly means: "to hurry up".The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed 
                by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.
                <br>
                A jam refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with 
                people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people 
                including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.

                The Parkour adventure began in France in the 1990s, in Lisses and Evry, in the outskirts of Paris. David Belle 
                originally developed the Parkour concept according to precepts about the art of movement laid down by his father, who was a Parisian firefighter.

                As teenagers, Belle and his friends from the Yamakasi group practised jumping and climbing over stairs, barriers, walls and other fixtures in his 
                city. Doing so, he made up what they called the art of moving, taking advantage of all the constructions and obstacles that were not originally  
                created for this purpose.

                For them, Parkour was just a kind of training method to overcome all forms of obstacles in urban and natural environments, such as forests. Since 
                the 90s, this way of moving, popularized more by its inclusion in the film industry, like the movie Yamakasi, co-written by Charles Perrière, one 
                of the founders of the discipline and the movie B13 with David Belle.

                These films have inspired various sporting events in many countries and have created a new generation of Tracers (Parkour practitioners) around 
                the world.

                While the founders of Parkour were not keen on competition, this trend made them consider sporting events as a good showcase for raising awareness 
                of the discipline around the world.
                After initiation workshops at the Lillehammer 2016 Youth Olympic Games, led By Charles Perrière, sparked increased interest in the discipline.

                David Belle and his friend Charles Perrière, sought to obtain formal recognition of Parkour to further its development.

                A connection was made with the FIG, a well-established federation within the Olympic movement, whose President, Morinari Watanabe, is a great 
                admirer of the discipline. The collaboration is a natural fit, as several national Gymnastics federations affiliated with the FIG already offer 
                Parkour activities.

                Since the FIG Executive Committee gave the green light, in February 2017, to develop the new sport, milestones have been reached at the speed of 
                an athlete tackling an obstacle course. Parkour’s development has opened the way for the launch of a first World Cup series within the framework 
                of the FISE (World Action Sports Festival), in 2018.
