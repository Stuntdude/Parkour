    		<h1>What is <span class="highlight">Parkour</span> ?</h1>
    		<p>
    			Parkour is a form of physical training aimed to overcome both physical and mental obstacles.
    			It is a sport that encourages self-improvement on all levels, revealing one’s physical and 
    			mental limits while simultaneously offering ways to overcome them. It is a method of training 
    			one’s body and mind in order to be as completely functional, effective and liberated as possible 
    			in any environment.The sport aims to build confidence, determination, self-discipline
    		    and self-reliance, and responsibility for one’s actions. It encourages humility, respect for
    		    others and for one’s environment, self-expression, community
    		    spirit, and the importance of play, discovery and safety at all times.

    			    		<summary>Landing</summary>
    			    		<p>Landing is one of the most important techniques to master in the practice of Parkour. 
    			    			Traceurs who do not land properly risk repeated damage to their legs, back and joints.
                                The key to safely landing is bending the knees when toes make contact with ground. Never land flat footed; 
                                always land on toes and ball of your foot. Do not land with your feet (exaggeratedly) stretched! This "technique", 
                                as often seen in videos, might slightly (if at all) reduce strain on the vertebral column on impact, but significantly 
                                increases the risk of ankle fracture. This is due to the specific anatomy of the ankle joint. Stability of the lower 
                                ankle joint is notably decreased in the plantarflexed condition (i.e. when the foot is "stretched") increasing the risk of 
                                severe injuries. This is also the reason why most people twist their ankle when walking/running downhill.</p>

    			    		<p>
    			    			The Parkour Roll is a very important skill to learn properly. The purpose of this roll is to lighten the 
    			    			impact of a fall or landing during your run. Practice safe rolls without much speed or height at first, on grass.

    			    		<summary>Cat Leap</summary>
    			    		<p>
    			    			A Cat leap (aka Saut de bras )is a common technique in parkour in which a traceur cannot make a jump from one 
    			    			point to another with his or her feet, and therefore must run at the 2nd point (usually a wall), and grab the 
    			    			top with their hands while simultaneously preventing their body from slamming into the wall using their feet.
                                To execute a cat leap, run at the top of a wall. Your legs should be extended partially in front of you once 
                                airborne. Absorb the impact with your legs first, potentially bending your knees and landing on the balls of 
                                your feet. Once the feet touch, grab the top of the wall with your hands. The cat leap has been completed. You 
                                may either drop down, jump to another wall, or pop on top or over current wall.

    			    		<p>
    			    			A jump is performed over an object feet first while the hands are then placed down to carry oneself over. 
    			    			The result will be a sitting position halfway through the vault with the arms used to push off the obstacle.

    			    		<p>
    			    			Both hands are placed on the obstacle and are used to push the traceur over the obstacle while both legs are 
    			    			pulled up into a squat position with the hips raised to pass over the object. Can also be done in a diving motion 
    			    			over the obstacle.

    			    		<summary>Precision Jump</summary>
    			    		<p>
    			    			A precision jump is essentially a jump from a one obstacle to another obstacle landing on your two feet. 
    			    		    The word "precision" refers to the accuracy needed to land the jump, for example landing on a rail or bollard 
    			    	        requires more precision than a large wall or rock.

    			    		<summary>Tic Tac</summary>
    			    		<p>
    			    			A Tic Tac or simply Tac is a movement used in Parkour and Freerunning. It consists of pushing off of a wall, 
    			    			similar to a wallrun, but moving across the wall rather than up it. It is usually used to get over an obstacle 
    			    			next to a wall.

    			    		<p>
    			    			Strides are a series of jumps combined into one fluid movement, used in Parkour and Freerunning. 
    			    			They are similar to a series of precision leaps, but without the precision landing (instead, the landing 
    			    			is only on one foot and the momentum is immediately used to go into another leap). They are used when there 
    			    			are a number of obstacles on a given path.

    		<h1><span class="highlight">Risks</span> coming along</h1>
    		<p>
    			Parkour has its risks and benefits, but if practiced in a safe environment it will be a great experience for the traceur 
    			and benefit them both mentally and physicaly.<br>
    			Parkour can also conclude in personal injury from landing wrong, failing a move, or falling from a high place.<br>
    			There is also the risk a long term injury such as paralysis.<br>
                Parkour draws many traceurs to private locations and this can resolve in property damage, fines, and use of inappropriate places.

    		<h1><span class="highlight">Benefits</span> coming along</h1>
    		<p>
    			Parkour is physically demanding so builds strength and improves fitness.<br>
                Using obstacles to aid your movements, it helps with balance, spatial awareness and coordination.<br>
                Parkour will help you develop self-reliance and confidence.<br>
                You can practice parkour alone which is great for developing self-discipline but there are also 
                communities of people who do it together.
